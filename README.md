r-matlab-toolbox
================

Several of the engineering courses I teach rely on MATLAB as the primary computing tool. In this toolbox, I'm experimenting with the [`reach`](https://github.com/schmidtchristoph/reach) package to run MATLAB from R, using R Markdown scripts to create course materials reproducibly.

-   [Write a MATLAB function from R](scripts/02_functions.md)
-   [functions.R](scripts/functions.R)
-   [Bode plot](scripts/03_bode.md)
