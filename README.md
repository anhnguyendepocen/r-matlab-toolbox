======================

I have numerous labs, tutorials, homework sets, and exams that rely on the MATLAB environment. I can make these class materials more reproducible by using the [reach](https://github.com/schmidtchristoph/reach) package by Christoph Schmidt.

I'm using RStudio and R Markdown with `knitr`, `reach`, `R.matlab`, and the tidyverse packages on a Windows machine.
