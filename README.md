# r-matlab-toolbox

Several of the engineering courses I teach rely on MATLAB as the primary computing tool.  In this toolbox, I'm experimenting with the [`reach`](https://github.com/schmidtchristoph/reach) package to run MATLAB from R,  using R Markdown scripts to create course materials reproducibly. 

## ready for use 

- [functions.R](scripts/functions.R) 
- [Bode plot](scripts/03_bode.md) [(script only)](scripts/03_bode.txt) 

## explorations 

- [Bode plot test case](scripts/01_bode_test.md) 
- [Write a MATLAB function from R](scripts/02_functions.md)
