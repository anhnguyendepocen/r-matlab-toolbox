# r-matlab-toolbox

In this toolbox, I'm experimenting with the [`reach`](https://github.com/schmidtchristoph/reach) package to create course materials that include MATLAB syntax and output. My goal is to gradually improve the reproducibility of my course source files. 

  
## tools 

- [functions.R](scripts/functions.R) 
- [Bode plot](scripts/03_bode.md) [(script only)](scripts/03_bode.txt) 
- [Step response](scripts/04_step.md) [(script only)](scripts/04_step.txt) 

## explorations 

- [First test case: Bode plot](scripts/01_bode_test.md) 
- [Using R to write a MATLAB function](scripts/02_functions.md)
