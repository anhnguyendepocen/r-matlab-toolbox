# step plot

Based on the script for the Bode plot but with `step(sys)`. 

## initialize

Initialize knitr. 

```{r 04-01, echo = TRUE}
library(knitr)
opts_knit$set(root.dir = "../")
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, comment = NA)
```

`functions.R ` both loads my R functions and writes user-defined MATLAB functions to file in the `derived/`  directory. 

```{r 04-02}
source('scripts/functions.R')
```


## m-file 

Write the m-file. 

The optional comment `% print_stop` separates lines above for printing (code I want students to see) from lines below (concealed from students) when printing code using `print_mfile()`. 

```{r 04-03}
# step response m-file
m_script <- "% assign parameters
K  = 1;
wn = 100;
z  = 0.5;

% create the transfer function
n = K;
d = [1/wn^2  2*z/wn  1];
sys = tf(n, d);

% compute and plot the unit step response
step(sys)
grid

% print_stop 

% save results
write_sys(sys, 'results/sys_tf.txt')
write_gcf(gcf, 'results/m04_step.png', 6, 4)
"
```

Run the m-file. 

The function `run_mfile()` launches MATLAB only if the code has changed since the last run or if this run is the first. To force the code to run, delete the `derived/old.rds` file (if it exists).  

```{r 04-04}
# run the m-file if necessary
run_mfile(m_script)
```

If, when running MATLAB from R, the Command window shows a "path" warning, run `set_path()`. 

## results 

Finally, print the code I want students to see,  the transfer function,  and the Bode plot.  

```{r 04-05}
# print the m-file up to the line % print_stop
print_mfile(m_script)

# print the sys tfansfer function from tf()
print_sys('results/sys_tf.txt')

# print the graph
knitr::include_graphics('../results/m04_step.png')
```
