% pathStr = genpath_exclude(basePath,ignoreDirs)
%
% Extension of Matlab's "genpath" function, except this will exclude
% directories (and their sub-tree) given by "ignoreDirs".
%
% license at end of file
%
% Inputs:
%    basePath: string.  The base path for which to generate path string.
%
%    excludeDirs: cell-array of strings. all directory names to ignore. Note,
%                 these strings are passed into regexp surrounded by
%                 '^'   and '$'.  If your directory name contains special
%                 characters to regexp, they must be escaped.  For example,
%                 use '\.svn' to ignore ".svn" directories.  You may also
%                 use regular expressions to ignore certian patterns. For
%                 example, use '*._ert_rtw' to ignore all directories ending
%                 with "_ert_rtw".
%
% Outputs:
%    pathStr: string. semicolon delimited string of paths. (see genpath)

% minor cleanup.  Made input more robust so that if user enters a string as 'excudeDir' rather than a cell array of strings this function will still work.  (did this by moving the '^' and '$' to surround the entire regexp string, rather than wrapping them around each "excludeDir")
